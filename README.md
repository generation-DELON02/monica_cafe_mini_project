# Monica's Mini Project :)

## Overview:
The client has launched a pop-up cafe in a busy business district. They
are offering delivered home-made lunches and refreshments to the
surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which
helps them to log and track orders.

## Requirements:
• I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
• When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the
  system.
• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
  out-for-delivery, delivered.
• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
• When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.

## How To:
This is a program that runs on the command line (CLI).
Simply run the file, and follow the instructions in the terminal

## Key learnings:
• Reading and writing to both .txt files and .csv files
• Writing MYSQL queries to access or update any row in the database
